#### Emulators

### App UI

- Unidentified games and games with no cover art will now be shown with handwritten labels that can be edited! Older versions of Nostlan ignored them.
- fixed the stuttering when scrolling by completely replacing the old scrolling mechanics with a better method for achieving the same aesthetic results
- mouse hides automatically when using a controller, reappears when moved
- When the user selects a box from the game library menu, the box select menu zooms in on the whole library to focus on that game box. You can scroll and move the cursor to other games in this zoomed in state.
- Open box menu added for Wii U, Switch, GBA, Arcade, and SNES. The only systems missing this feature are now the PS3 and 3DS.
- More intuitive UI labelling. On the game library view, clicking "Sys", short for systems, will open a submenu where you can choose to load another system's game library. Clicking "Play" opens the Play Menu, you can choose which emulator should be used to play your selected game. Clicking "Emu", will open the emulator menu. In the emulator menu click "Configure {emu name}" to start the emulator without a game so you can setup controllers, change graphics settings, update the emulator, etc. In previous versions the labels on the library view were "Power", "Reset", and "Open" just like on a GameCube which aesthetically looked cool but it's just a terrible way to label the functions of those buttons and I should've changed it sooner.
- update Yuzu via Nostlan's Emulator Menu
- unlock alternate UI theme color palettes (Patreon supporter premium feature)
- custom UI theming, lets you change the intro loading screens and make your own color palettes (Patreon supporter premium feature)

#### User Experience

- The readme page was way too long, I broke it up into separate wiki pages. I've put a lot more effort into documenting Nostlan on the [wiki](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki). I hope you find it helpful!
- Precise Nintendo Switch game identification! Nostlan uses `yuzu-cmd.exe` to identify your games using its 16 hex digit title id. Since the Switch is a current gen console a complete database for switch games that has all the title ids doesn't exist yet ofc. Nostlan's Switch database has some title id's for older Nintendo Switch games. I added some newer ones myself for the most popular games.
- Precise SNES game identification! Nostlan uses `icarus.exe` to identify SNES games. It doesn't work on some files but it's pretty good with .sfc roms.

</a></p>

#### Development

- updated open source license to GNU GPLv3
- contro-ui (my controller ui framework) now uses hierarchal submenus. I replaced a lot of bodge code.

## Coming Soon

#### Emulators

- [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/download/) support (alt Switch emulator that can run 32bit games, unlike Yuzu). I planned to have it working in v1.8.x but Ryujinx can't be run via spawning a child process. I've submitted a [bug report](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/issues/1106) to the Ryujinx devs so hopefully they will have a fix soon.

### App UI

- update emulators via Nostlan's emulator menu
- show game wiki pages in the `manuals` section of the open box menus
- better region support for Europe and Japan: UI translations and improvements to Nostlan's game art databases

#### User Experience

- users will be able to manually identify games by searching through Nostlan's game databases and then Nostlan will load cover art for that game
- Users will be able to identify game mods that aren't found in Nostlan's game databases. Mod boxes will have the original game art with the mod's title on a label sticker.
- precise game identification for Nintendo DS games
- precise Wii/Gamecube/VC game identification using `Dolphin.exe` and robotjs to get the game id values directly from the main ui's game table
- when an emulator app is not found Nostlan will prompt the user for the location of the app or if Nostlan should download and install it automatically

## Supporting Multiple Emulators per System

When users launch a game, a menu will appear prompting users to choose which emulator they want to play the game with!

To implement this new feature in a way that made sense, I had to rethink what the default paths to your emulators and games should be.

If you've used Nostlan before, when you load this update Nostlan will attempt to reorganize the default paths to your emulators and games. This update breaks compatibility with all older versions of Nostlan. The folders for game images and user game list files have been moved into their respective system folder in `emu`.

Example of what the OPTIONAL default Nostlan file structure looks like on Windows. Its optional but I do highly recommend using it as it makes using the Nostlan so much easier. As always, you can edit emulator app and game library locations in your user preferences file. For more info read [Setting up Nostlan](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/nostlan/wiki/Setting-up-Nostlan).

## Let me know what you think about Nostlan

Nostlan is an experimental project but I want to make it intuitive and useful for the general public! If something is wrong with the app or if you have any questions please email me <mailto:qashto@gmail.com> or write up an issue report on Github. What do you think of the features I have planned? What should I prioritize?

# Support the Development of Nostlan!

Patreon supporters get premium features for only $1 a month!

- backup/sync game saves to the cloud or local storage device
- unlock alternate UI theme color palettes
- custom UI theming, lets you change the intro loading screens and make your own color palettes

Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use the app please support its development. Thank you!

Features that might be offered in the future:

- support for your PC game libraries! (Origin, Steam, Epic Games, etc.)

I'm going to make a lot of videos about Nostlan which will hopefully make it easier for new users to start using the app. Ideally I would like to have 200+ supporters to consider working on Nostlan a worthwhile investment of my time. If Nostlan got 500+ supporters and I made ~$1,500 a month from Patreon, I would work on Nostlan full time and come out with updates a lot more frequently! If you use Nostlan a lot I really don't think $1 a month is too much to ask. Please support this open source project!
