## Update Summary for v2.0.x

Performance update! Nostlan now generates thumbnail images with a height of 720px that are used on the game library view. It automatically switches to using the full res game art when you select a game. Scrolling and animations are now smooth even for really large libraries. This update also adds NES support!

#### Emulators

- NES game library and Mesen emulator support!
- [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/download/) support (alternate Switch emulator that can run 32bit games, unlike Yuzu)

#### App UI

- shows game wiki pages in the `manuals` section of the open box menus (works for wii, n3ds, and switch)

#### User Experience

- search for games on the game library view just by typing (no search bar), just like with Windows File Explorer
- increased performance in the game library view due to the use of thumbnail images

## Coming Soon

#### Emulators

- Built-in support for em-fceux, a javascript port of fceux as the default emulator for nes. Currently em-fceux is missing a critical features, the ability to export save states to a file for use on other devices. I've been in contact with the developer, hopefully this feature will be implemented soon!

## Let me know what you think about Nostlan

Nostlan is an experimental project but I want to make it intuitive and useful for the general public! If something is wrong with the app or if you have any questions please email me <mailto:qashto@gmail.com> or write up an issue report on Github. What do you think of the features I have planned? What should I prioritize?

Even though I decided to make this project open source and free to use, it still took a lot of work and a long time to develop. If you appreciate my work so far and will continue to use the app please support its development. Thank you!

Features that might be offered in the future:

- support for your PC game libraries! (Origin, Steam, Epic Games, etc.)

I'm going to make a lot of videos about Nostlan which will hopefully make it easier for new users to start using the app. Ideally I would like to have 200+ supporters to consider working on Nostlan a worthwhile investment of my time. If Nostlan got 500+ supporters and I made ~$1,500 a month from Patreon, I would work on Nostlan full time and come out with updates a lot more frequently. If you use Nostlan a lot I really don't think $1 a month is too much to ask. Please support this open source project!
